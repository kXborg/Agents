The screen displays a Windows desktop featuring a PowerShell window in the foreground. Within PowerShell, a Python script (`openAgent.py`) is executing, tasked to "Summarise what's on screen in 100 words and save it as text file." The output shows "Generating action plan..." and "Done." Behind this, a Google Chrome browser window is partially visible, showing the Google search homepage. This page includes quick access icons for services like Google Meet, Drive, and GitHub. A "Continue with these tabs" section lists recent browsing, featuring links related to "oLLM," "vlm-bench," and "ChatGPT - VLMs." The desktop background is a blurred image of small green plants.
